R code for "Modeling Homophily in Dynamic Networks with Application to HIV Molecular Surveillance"

This is the repository for R code of the paper titled "Modeling Homophily in Dynamic Networks with Application to HIV Molecular Surveillance". Scenario I and II correspond to the two set-ups documented in Supplementary material of the paper. Within each scenario, we consider two cases (1) cluster size is fixed, NLC will be assigned to an existing cluster, (2) cluster size is increasing, NLC will either be assigned to an existing cluster or will form its own cluster. 

We also check under incomplete sampling case the estimates from our transmission network set-up are still consistent.
